  <h1>Welcome to My Website!</h1>
  <p>Hi! I am <b>Maddie Goldberg</b></p>
  <br>
  <p>Developmental Cognitive Neuroscience PhD student at the University of Oregon </p>
  <br>
  <p>My work primarily focuses on reward-related neuroendocrine relationships across adoelscence, particularly how adrenal androgens and gonadal steroids partly affect reward-related brain function and drive decision-making. I recieved my B.S. in Psychology (with Honors) and additional Applied Statitstics and Sociology minors at the University of Pittsburgh. I also recieved a competative 2-year post-baccalaureate IRTA Fellowship from the National Institutes of Mental Health within the Sections on Behavioral Endocrinology and Integrative Neuroscience.</p>
  <br>
  <p> Outside of work I love to swim, bike, run (no triatholons yet...), and read! </p>
